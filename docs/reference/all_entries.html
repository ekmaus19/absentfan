And it was because of this expertise that he was now questioning just what her intentions were when she invited him to Israel. Tag 11x01 and continues into a true-to-character speculative AU.

So is Gibbs, but the question is why? Then a tell-all manuscript comes to light, and Gibbs realizes that the admiral had a few stories to tell, stories someone would kill to keep from ever reaching the printers.

When the unexpected happens, the couple will have to lean on each other and the team to find comfort in the hardest challenge they have ever faced, letting go of one of their teammates.

Tony-centric, Tim, Kate, and Ziva bashing. Each 'episode' is a separate, singular, isolated incident.

#&gt; 30     Throughout the series there were lots of instances Gibbs was a real good friend/almost father to Tony. But there were also some really hurtful things he said to him that bordered on being extremely cruel and that couldn't be considered 'funny' even if we wanted to. Other times, Jenny seemed caring but was, in reality, using Tony for her own goal. What if one day Tony had enough?

Join the Shepard-Gibbs family as they learn how to live together through the good, the bad and the ugly, how will they deal when old relationships come into question and new relationships blossom? Will Jenny and Gibbs be able to keep everything together for the kids or will it all fall apart before it has a chance to even really begin?

The fallout is not what is expected at all, not by anyone especially not by Gibbs.

This story views the events of 13x24 "Family First" (and MORE!) from the viewpoint of little Tali.

This edit inspired this whole story.) AU

A few cups of coffee couldn't possibly cause a stir at NCIS. Sadly, trouble is brewing for Tony and McGee.

Gibbs stops by Jenny's house. Jibbs because erm, well I love it if you had not already figured that out

Probably set in Tony's last season. One shot.
#&gt; 189                                                                                                                                                                       Judgment day. Jenny lives but ends up in a horrible fight with Gibbs, a fight that marks the beginning of the end. They now have to deal with their own emotions and find a way to work together. This story is COMPLETED!

Gibbs has lost his glasses once again! Very fluffy, no plot, I just wanted to have a little fun. Please let me know what you think and if you would like to see more from me! Kate/Gibbs, T rating for language.

Gibbs is angry. Everyone else in the workplace is sick of the unresolved sexual tension between them. Random one-shot with a dash of humor.
#&gt; 192                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Do you believe in magic?

How will the re-emergence of this friend impact her relationship with Tony? This isn't even a summary, but all these questions will be answered in this story! TIVA! I'm not good at these things, but give it a read maybe?
#&gt; 194                                                                                                                 A number of unconnected one shots with very different ways in which Tony might first have met Gibbs. Probably very AU! Each chapter complete in itself. The story is marked as complete but occasionally I think of another scenario - as has just happened with new chapter 28.

#&gt; 197                                                                                                         They often say, that time heals all wounds. It doesn't completely heal them, all time does is dull the emotions. Even though the emotions are dulled, they're still present; wherever you are, wherever you go and are present 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. They never really go away.
#&gt; 198             As Tony and the others draw closer to identifying The Calling's new leader, the group takes steps throw the task force off their trail. Meanwhile back in DC, Gibbs and the MCRT have cause for concern and decide to investigate when a series of seemingly unrelated events all lead back to Tony as the common denominator. Part 3 of 3 - immediately follows "Blank Pages". Gen.

NCIS isn't that big as an organisation in comparison to the rest of the alphabet. They were bound to run into each other eventually. Gibbs just didn't think she'd be mid-op with Mossad when they did.

This is a revisiting of an older story but I don't think you need read that one to understand this one. Mostly Tony and Gibbs but other characters are involved as well. One shot.
#&gt; 202                                                                One year has passed since Tony gave up searching for Ziva to give their daughter Tali the steady life she deserves. But things are changing. Old friends are moving on. New friends are distant. Should he move on too? Or should he fight until the end? Picks up right after Abby leaves NCIS in "Two Steps Back" per season 15

One question, and Tony suddenly faces much more than just a teasing, flirty partnership. And maybe, just maybe, something good? Tiva! One-shot, rated T for swearing.
#&gt; 204                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Set after Judgment Day. Jenny takes a trip to Gibbs's basement to apologize.

"Only in the bedroom," he says, and Ziva makes it her personal goal to hear that word from his lips. One-shot, Tiva fluff!
#&gt; 206                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     It's Christmas. Ziva's first Christmas, actually, and Tony's first Hanukkah. Just a short one-shot, pure fluff! Tiva. Enjoy!

One-shots, Tony and Ziva, but not always Tiva.

On rare occasions they even have time for themselves... Definitely JIBBS - a lot of romance, humor and troubles with kids.

This series consists of tags from season 1 and each tag is a stand-alone vignette.

This one is about Jenny leaving Gibbs and taking Milly with her while she leaves Lily with him. The rating is there because of the swearing

Tiva centric.

#&gt; 235  What if tony took zivas words seriously and is going to leave ncis. all that is stopping him is his 4 years old son and mother of said son. will the team will be able to convince him that they actually care for him? and will Gibbs realize that there may be other people who will accept Tony as a son. crappy summery plz check chapter 1 for a deatailed summary. gibbs/tony father son.

How will Jenny fit in and how does she handle the changes in her life?

#&gt; 240                                      Kelly Gibbs didn't die in the car accident with her mother, Shannon. She was kidnapped and forced into the world of spooks and intrigue. Now that she has escaped will she finally be able to rediscover who she once was? How will her father react to her return? Who will she become now? Rated T for now though the rating may shift to M for violence.

He promised not to do anything-but she didn't. Tiva! One-shot for now. Enjoy!

"You plan on getting into situations like this often?" Tony counters. "…Most agent's wouldn't react to a situation like that" Gibbs pointed out. "Most agents don't have people trying to kill their boss like that either" Tony redirected.

Jibbs, mainly because my brain does not really want to write about anything else XD

Case based story with possible Gibbs/Other female and Tiva...

Pairing: Gibbs/Abby Categories: hurt, comfort, drama, fluff TEMPORARILY ABANDONED! I will get back to it eventually, but not sure how long that is going to take.

Would their story still be ruled by fate or does a fifteen year old teenager have a say in this? slight AU
#&gt; 247                                     This is AU and Tiva! Consider yourself warned. Ziva David is the daughter of a dead businessman, who is forced to work for her step-mother Orli and her step-sisters Gwen and Gertrude. Tony DiNozzo is the son of a rich man and is looking for love. Can they find happiness together? Or will their disapproving families tear them apart? Dun Dun Dun...
