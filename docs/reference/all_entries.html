The "supernatural" part of the storyline comes in to play in later chapters just as a side note for anyone planning on reading this.
#&gt; 13                            When her ballet comes to Washington, DC for the holidays, after her parents start investigating a naval officer who assaulted her little brother and his friend, Tali is asked to do something she never thought she would have to do in a million years.

When Tony is quiet all week long, Gibbs gets concerned. Why is Tony so quiet? What happened? The only time Gibbs has ever seen Tony quiet is when he's been sick. So what's going on?

A collection of shorts exploring this need. Part of the "You Complete Me" universe.
#&gt; 23                     It's been a month since Tony's attack, and everything that's happened - a relationship with Ziva, PTSD, the arrest of his attackers, and now a daunting trial that he doesn't know how he'll make it through - is just as scary as when it was brand new. He is terrified, and the only way to make it is to remember that they're not alone. (SEQUEL TO FOR YOU, LOOSELY S8)

#&gt; 58     Throughout the series there were lots of instances Gibbs was a real good friend/almost father to Tony. But there were also some really hurtful things he said to him that bordered on being extremely cruel and that couldn't be considered 'funny' even if we wanted to. Other times, Jenny seemed caring but was, in reality, using Tony for her own goal. What if one day Tony had enough?

The fallout is not what is expected at all, not by anyone especially not by Gibbs.

(BTW the cover is an edit and it and it says you'll be with me like a handprint on my heart, and now whatever ways our stories end know you have rewritten mine by being my friend. This edit inspired this whole story.) AU

A few cups of coffee couldn't possibly cause a stir at NCIS. Sadly, trouble is brewing for Tony and McGee.

Gibbs stops by Jenny's house. Jibbs because erm, well I love it if you had not already figured that out

Probably set in Tony's last season. One shot.

Jenny lives but ends up in a horrible fight with Gibbs, a fight that marks the beginning of the end. They now have to deal with their own emotions and find a way to work together. This story is COMPLETED!

Gibbs has lost his glasses once again! Very fluffy, no plot, I just wanted to have a little fun. Please let me know what you think and if you would like to see more from me! Kate/Gibbs, T rating for language.
#&gt; 211                                                                                                                                                                                                         Jenny is being irrational, in multiple ways. Gibbs is angry. Everyone else in the workplace is sick of the unresolved sexual tension between them. Random one-shot with a dash of humor.

How will the re-emergence of this friend impact her relationship with Tony? This isn't even a summary, but all these questions will be answered in this story! TIVA! I'm not good at these things, but give it a read maybe?
#&gt; 214                                                                                                                 A number of unconnected one shots with very different ways in which Tony might first have met Gibbs. Probably very AU! Each chapter complete in itself. The story is marked as complete but occasionally I think of another scenario - as has just happened with new chapter 28.

#&gt; 217                                                                                                         They often say, that time heals all wounds. It doesn't completely heal them, all time does is dull the emotions. Even though the emotions are dulled, they're still present; wherever you are, wherever you go and are present 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. They never really go away.
#&gt; 218                                                                                                                                                                      Set circa season 2. NCIS isn't that big as an organisation in comparison to the rest of the alphabet. They were bound to run into each other eventually. Gibbs just didn't think she'd be mid-op with Mossad when they did.
#&gt; 219                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Tony and Ziva have always had special smiles for the other; together they can light up the room. Part of the "You Complete Me" universe.

This is a revisiting of an older story but I don't think you need read that one to understand this one. Mostly Tony and Gibbs but other characters are involved as well. One shot.
#&gt; 221                                                                One year has passed since Tony gave up searching for Ziva to give their daughter Tali the steady life she deserves. But things are changing. Old friends are moving on. New friends are distant. Should he move on too? Or should he fight until the end? Picks up right after Abby leaves NCIS in "Two Steps Back" per season 15
#&gt; 222                                                                                                                                                                       "Aw, Ziva, do you really consider me 'in your life?" One question, and Tony suddenly faces much more than just a teasing, flirty partnership. And maybe, just maybe, something good? Tiva! One-shot, rated T for swearing.
#&gt; 223                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Set after Judgment Day. Jenny takes a trip to Gibbs's basement to apologize.

"Only in the bedroom," he says, and Ziva makes it her personal goal to hear that word from his lips. One-shot, Tiva fluff!
#&gt; 225                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     It's Christmas. Ziva's first Christmas, actually, and Tony's first Hanukkah. Just a short one-shot, pure fluff! Tiva. Enjoy!
#&gt; 226                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Snippets based on a self-appointed 30 day challenge, focused on summer. One-shots, Tony and Ziva, but not always Tiva.

Jenny visits Jethro after his near death experience.

On rare occasions they even have time for themselves... Definitely JIBBS - a lot of romance, humor and troubles with kids.

Can they find happiness together? Or will their disapproving families tear them apart? Dun Dun Dun...
