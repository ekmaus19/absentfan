And it was because of this expertise that he was now questioning just what her intentions were when she invited him to Israel. Tag 11x01 and continues into a true-to-character speculative AU.

So is Gibbs, but the question is why? Then a tell-all manuscript comes to light, and Gibbs realizes that the admiral had a few stories to tell, stories someone would kill to keep from ever reaching the printers.

Tony-centric, Tim, Kate, and Ziva bashing. Each 'episode' is a separate, singular, isolated incident.

#&gt; 29     Throughout the series there were lots of instances Gibbs was a real good friend/almost father to Tony. But there were also some really hurtful things he said to him that bordered on being extremely cruel and that couldn't be considered 'funny' even if we wanted to. Other times, Jenny seemed caring but was, in reality, using Tony for her own goal. What if one day Tony had enough?

This story views the events of 13x24 "Family First" (and MORE!) from the viewpoint of little Tali. While many often focus on the thoughts and emotions of her parents, Tony and Ziva, why not dig into what she is experiencing when suddenly, her entire world is turned upside-down? Tivali.

She's also got a gun and she's the newest member of Gibbs' team. You know that saying about judging a book by its cover? Well... surf's up.

#&gt; 150 I don't know where I am. I found a hole, crawled through and ended up here... wherever here is. And I don't know how I got from there to here at a crime scene with my picture at the top of the suspect list. I don't even know if I can find the hole I crawled through. All I know is I'm here, it happened, and I don't know how to get out of this mess. OC. May contain spoilers First Fic
#&gt; 151                                           Ziva writes her life in hope that Tony will find her. Up to 15.24 but I doubt there are spoilers for anything past 13.24. (BTW the cover is an edit and it and it says you'll be with me like a handprint on my heart, and now whatever ways our stories end know you have rewritten mine by being my friend. This edit inspired this whole story.) AU

It's also Totally Abby which everyone who see's it comments on. Also Tony manages to get in trouble with Gibbs, Director or not.

#&gt; 157                                                                                     Part seven of my CIA series. The tables have turned for Tim and Levi Carew. For the first time, Levi is not the one in control. Tim is. And the reason is not what anyone on the NCIS team would have expected...or wanted. Tim is featured, but the entire team is present and accounted for. Now complete.

Falling for your best friend. Not exactly the best situation to be in. Love is complicated at the best of times, never mind with added obstacles. But for these two best friends, added obstacles are the norms.

Some angst. Could be considered Gibbs bashing. Maybe.

But what connection does his girlfriend have in connection with Gibbs and has McGee finally found his perfect match?

Knowing she's a serial killer... Has Gibbs lost his mind, or is he smarter than I gave him credit for?

A few cups of coffee couldn't possibly cause a stir at NCIS. Sadly, trouble is brewing for Tony and McGee.

Gibbs stops by Jenny's house. Jibbs because erm, well I love it if you had not already figured that out

Probably set in Tony's last season. One shot.

Jenny lives but ends up in a horrible fight with Gibbs, a fight that marks the beginning of the end. They now have to deal with their own emotions and find a way to work together. This story is COMPLETED!

Gibbs is angry. Everyone else in the workplace is sick of the unresolved sexual tension between them. Random one-shot with a dash of humor.

How will the re-emergence of this friend impact her relationship with Tony? This isn't even a summary, but all these questions will be answered in this story! TIVA! I'm not good at these things, but give it a read maybe?
#&gt; 193                                                                                                                 A number of unconnected one shots with very different ways in which Tony might first have met Gibbs. Probably very AU! Each chapter complete in itself. The story is marked as complete but occasionally I think of another scenario - as has just happened with new chapter 28.

#&gt; 196                                                                                                         They often say, that time heals all wounds. It doesn't completely heal them, all time does is dull the emotions. Even though the emotions are dulled, they're still present; wherever you are, wherever you go and are present 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. They never really go away.
#&gt; 197             As Tony and the others draw closer to identifying The Calling's new leader, the group takes steps throw the task force off their trail. Meanwhile back in DC, Gibbs and the MCRT have cause for concern and decide to investigate when a series of seemingly unrelated events all lead back to Tony as the common denominator. Part 3 of 3 - immediately follows "Blank Pages". Gen.
#&gt; 198                                                                                                                                                                      Set circa season 2. NCIS isn't that big as an organisation in comparison to the rest of the alphabet. They were bound to run into each other eventually. Gibbs just didn't think she'd be mid-op with Mossad when they did.
#&gt; 199                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Tony and Ziva have always had special smiles for the other; together they can light up the room.

This is a revisiting of an older story but I don't think you need read that one to understand this one. Mostly Tony and Gibbs but other characters are involved as well. One shot.
#&gt; 201                                                                One year has passed since Tony gave up searching for Ziva to give their daughter Tali the steady life she deserves. But things are changing. Old friends are moving on. New friends are distant. Should he move on too? Or should he fight until the end? Picks up right after Abby leaves NCIS in "Two Steps Back" per season 15

Tiva centric.

How will Jenny fit in and how does she handle the changes in her life?

#&gt; 239                                      Kelly Gibbs didn't die in the car accident with her mother, Shannon. She was kidnapped and forced into the world of spooks and intrigue. Now that she has escaped will she finally be able to rediscover who she once was? How will her father react to her return? Who will she become now? Rated T for now though the rating may shift to M for violence.

"You plan on getting into situations like this often?" Tony counters. "…Most agent's wouldn't react to a situation like that" Gibbs pointed out. "Most agents don't have people trying to kill their boss like that either" Tony redirected.

Case based story with possible Gibbs/Other female and Tiva...

Pairing: Gibbs/Abby Categories: hurt, comfort, drama, fluff TEMPORARILY ABANDONED! I will get back to it eventually, but not sure how long that is going to take.

Would their story still be ruled by fate or does a fifteen year old teenager have a say in this? slight AU
#&gt; 246                                     This is AU and Tiva! Consider yourself warned. Ziva David is the daughter of a dead businessman, who is forced to work for her step-mother Orli and her step-sisters Gwen and Gertrude. Tony DiNozzo is the son of a rich man and is looking for love. Can they find happiness together? Or will their disapproving families tear them apart? Dun Dun Dun...

#&gt; 261                      It is just a simple injury. Nothing serious. And yet, the doctor tells Gibbs his agent didn't make it. How is this possible? The group is grieving but suspicious things keep happening and in the end, it's possible that nothing is what it originally seems to be. Is Tony really dead? What exactly happened?
