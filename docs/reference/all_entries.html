The "supernatural" part of the storyline comes in to play in later chapters just as a side note for anyone planning on reading this.
#&gt; 2                                                                                                                       A quiet Tony is never a good sign, because a quiet Tony means that something is wrong. When Tony is quiet all week long, Gibbs gets concerned. Why is Tony so quiet? What happened? The only time Gibbs has ever seen Tony quiet is when he's been sick. So what's going on?

#&gt; 168                                           Ziva writes her life in hope that Tony will find her. Up to 15.24 but I doubt there are spoilers for anything past 13.24. (BTW the cover is an edit and it and it says you'll be with me like a handprint on my heart, and now whatever ways our stories end know you have rewritten mine by being my friend. This edit inspired this whole story.) AU

A few cups of coffee couldn't possibly cause a stir at NCIS. Sadly, trouble is brewing for Tony and McGee.

Gibbs stops by Jenny's house. Jibbs because erm, well I love it if you had not already figured that out

Probably set in Tony's last season. One shot.

Jenny lives but ends up in a horrible fight with Gibbs, a fight that marks the beginning of the end. They now have to deal with their own emotions and find a way to work together. This story is COMPLETED!
#&gt; 205                                                                                                                         My first ever fanfiction! AU, flirty Gibbs, pouty Kate. Gibbs has lost his glasses once again! Very fluffy, no plot, I just wanted to have a little fun. Please let me know what you think and if you would like to see more from me! Kate/Gibbs, T rating for language.

Gibbs is angry. Everyone else in the workplace is sick of the unresolved sexual tension between them. Random one-shot with a dash of humor.
#&gt; 207                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Do you believe in magic?

How will the re-emergence of this friend impact her relationship with Tony? This isn't even a summary, but all these questions will be answered in this story! TIVA! I'm not good at these things, but give it a read maybe?
#&gt; 209                                                                                                                 A number of unconnected one shots with very different ways in which Tony might first have met Gibbs. Probably very AU! Each chapter complete in itself. The story is marked as complete but occasionally I think of another scenario - as has just happened with new chapter 28.

#&gt; 212                                                                                                         They often say, that time heals all wounds. It doesn't completely heal them, all time does is dull the emotions. Even though the emotions are dulled, they're still present; wherever you are, wherever you go and are present 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. They never really go away.
#&gt; 213                                                                                                                                                                      Set circa season 2. NCIS isn't that big as an organisation in comparison to the rest of the alphabet. They were bound to run into each other eventually. Gibbs just didn't think she'd be mid-op with Mossad when they did.
#&gt; 214                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Tony and Ziva have always had special smiles for the other; together they can light up the room. Part of the "You Complete Me" universe.
#&gt; 215                                                                                                           Tony and Gibbs alone in the office - silliness ensues and we see different sides to the characters. This is a revisiting of an older story but I don't think you need read that one to understand this one. Mostly Tony and Gibbs but other characters are involved as well. One shot.
#&gt; 216                                                                One year has passed since Tony gave up searching for Ziva to give their daughter Tali the steady life she deserves. But things are changing. Old friends are moving on. New friends are distant. Should he move on too? Or should he fight until the end? Picks up right after Abby leaves NCIS in "Two Steps Back" per season 15
#&gt; 217                                                                                                                                                                       "Aw, Ziva, do you really consider me 'in your life?" One question, and Tony suddenly faces much more than just a teasing, flirty partnership. And maybe, just maybe, something good? Tiva! One-shot, rated T for swearing.
#&gt; 218                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Set after Judgment Day. Jenny takes a trip to Gibbs's basement to apologize.
#&gt; 219                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Tony refuses to say please... "Only in the bedroom," he says, and Ziva makes it her personal goal to hear that word from his lips. One-shot, Tiva fluff!
#&gt; 220                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     It's Christmas. Ziva's first Christmas, actually, and Tony's first Hanukkah. Just a short one-shot, pure fluff! Tiva. Enjoy!

Part of my Lily and Milly series.
#&gt; 224                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Tag to the episode "Requiem". Jenny visits Jethro after his near death experience.

On rare occasions they even have time for themselves... Definitely JIBBS - a lot of romance, humor and troubles with kids.

"You plan on getting into situations like this often?" Tony counters. "…Most agent's wouldn't react to a situation like that" Gibbs pointed out. "Most agents don't have people trying to kill their boss like that either" Tony redirected.

Jibbs, mainly because my brain does not really want to write about anything else XD

Case based story with possible Gibbs/Other female and Tiva...

Pairing: Gibbs/Abby Categories: hurt, comfort, drama, fluff TEMPORARILY ABANDONED! I will get back to it eventually, but not sure how long that is going to take.

Would their story still be ruled by fate or does a fifteen year old teenager have a say in this? slight AU
#&gt; 261                                     This is AU and Tiva! Consider yourself warned. Ziva David is the daughter of a dead businessman, who is forced to work for her step-mother Orli and her step-sisters Gwen and Gertrude. Tony DiNozzo is the son of a rich man and is looking for love. Can they find happiness together? Or will their disapproving families tear them apart? Dun Dun Dun...

Tony shows everyone just how smart he is. Oneshot.
