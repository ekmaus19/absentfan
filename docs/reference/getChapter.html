#&gt;  [3] "5th year Sirius Black yelled to his three best friends- his marauders- in the empty hallways of the infamous Potter Manor. He was running through the corridor, looking for the room that he had just found."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
#&gt;  [4] "Right, left, left, straight, right, he thought as he was retracing his steps to the mysterious room that he just found while roaming through the halls, looking for interesting things in his new home now that his parents disowned him and kicked him out of his house. He couldn't be more glad. Except one thing- his little brother, Regulus. Their parents had been shoving ancient pureblood beliefs like that a pureblood was a higher caliber of wizard and half-bloods were meant to bow down to them while muggle-borns stole their magic and shouldn't be allowed to have a education with everyone else. Sirius doubted these things, but didn't say anything until he became a Gryffindor and met his best mates. Reg on the other hand, never had anyone like the marauders to show him that everything that their parents ever told them was false and that dark magic wasn't good. Because of this, he started hanging out with darker people like Yaxley or Avery. Walburga and Orion still had hope that Sirius would 'come to his senses' and start going into darker things. They were disappointed and angry when he told them that 'he was going to finds a nice muggle girl to shag' and they told him not to come for christmas holiday."
#&gt;  [5] "So here he was, on December 21, 1976, looking at two giant doors that were at least 10 feet tall…. because magic. Then, Rem, Jamie, and Peter came into the room a little out of breath. They all took a moment to let the intricate designs of the ginormous doors sink in."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
#&gt;  [6] "They were wooden doors with fancy carvings all throughout the top, they could see all of the little carvings that must have taken forever to carve. This wasn't some carving spells and done, this was hand-crafted, used with muggle knives. The doors themselves were beautiful. They were made of oak wood, with brass buttons throughout. It was the most beautiful and intricate thing Sirius ever saw- and that is saying something, he grew up in a 'proper' pureblood household with ancient artifacts passed down from generations of Blacks and Crabbes."
