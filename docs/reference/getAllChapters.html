He was running through the corridor, looking for the room that he had just found.

He couldn't be more glad. Except one thing- his little brother, Regulus. Their parents had been shoving ancient pureblood beliefs like that a pureblood was a higher caliber of wizard and half-bloods were meant to bow down to them while muggle-borns stole their magic and shouldn't be allowed to have a education with everyone else. Sirius doubted these things, but didn't say anything until he became a Gryffindor and met his best mates. Reg on the other hand, never had anyone like the marauders to show him that everything that their parents ever told them was false and that dark magic wasn't good. Because of this, he started hanging out with darker people like Yaxley or Avery. Walburga and Orion still had hope that Sirius would 'come to his senses' and start going into darker things. They were disappointed and angry when he told them that 'he was going to finds a nice muggle girl to shag' and they told him not to come for christmas holiday.

Then, Rem, Jamie, and Peter came into the room a little out of breath. They all took a moment to let the intricate designs of the ginormous doors sink in.

This wasn't some carving spells and done, this was hand-crafted, used with muggle knives. The doors themselves were beautiful. They were made of oak wood, with brass buttons throughout. It was the most beautiful and intricate thing Sirius ever saw- and that is saying something, he grew up in a 'proper' pureblood household with ancient artifacts passed down from generations of Blacks and Crabbes.

They all knew that Sirius was obsessed with all things muggle. He would often ask Remus what certain things were because he was the person with the closest muggle relative- his mother was a muggle. He was crazy about a lot of the muggle band like The Beatles, Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Queen, Aerosmith, Eagles, Sex Pistols, etc. he had so many muggle rock band, muggle motorcycles, and most importantly, muggle girls in bikinis posters along with Gryffindor banners all with permanent sticking charms just to spite his parents.

He thought it was some kind of portal or sort of like something in the muggle comic books that he got remus to help smuggle into Grimmauld Place.

He wasn't shaking because he was scared (that much), but more of excitement.

Let's just hope that Minnie won't scream out in joy when she sees our wonderful faces"

All four of the boys knew this path like the back of their hands, so the walk was quite boring. They usually didn't takes this way, instead they always went through the tunnel that let to Honeydukes that they found in first year, or the path from the Whomping Willow to help with Rem's lycanthropy- also called 'furry little problem' or 'time of the month' to said's annoyment. But Remus was very grateful when his best friends told him that they had become animagi. He was lucky to have friends like them, but he was scared. He was scared that one day, he might go out of control and hurt one of them. they had already been with him for four full moons, and every time he hated it, but let them go with him even though he believed that he was a monster and he should never be loved the way that his friends loved him. At the beginning of first year, Remus would always try to stay away from his dormates and he saw Sirius doing the same thing. Whenever the full moon came, he would leave the common room at about 8 at night. All the Professors, except for DADA, knew of his inner monster so if a prefect caught him, he would never get in trouble. If anyone ever asked, he would always use the excuse that he didn't feel well or his mother was sick. This was all good until a young witch with green eyes and red hair confronted him.

Lily and Remus had all the same classes together, and sat next to each other in almost every one of them. Lily was very nice and he could see why James fancied her. If she didn't sit with Remus, she sat with her Slytherin friend Snape the marauders hated him now, but back then, a lot of things were different. Lily was a smart witch and was often found in the library. She was interested in all things magical, since she was muggle born. Around the second month of the first year, she started to look further into the moon and its effects which scared Remus for he feared that she would find out about his monstrous side and be repulsed, which would be a very bad thing because she was his only friend. On the night of the full moon, on his way to Madam Pomfrey, Lily intercepted him. She confronted him about being a werewolf, but she didn't seem repulsed or scared of him. Instead, she hugged him with tears in his eyes. Until the middle of second year, when the Marauders found out, she was the only person he could talk to about the monster inside of him.

Luckily, no one was in the corridor.

It was most likely due to the fact that he was the chaser and has been for four years- and also playing as reserve seeker. His Quidditch skills helped form his body. Back in first through third year, he was scrawny and looked like no one ever fed him, even though he ate more than a hungry Hungarian Horntail.

Prongs. James. "James, h-how are you here" Professor McGonagall asked, tears about to fall from her face. She would never admit it to anyone, but she had always had a secret liking to the boys. She saw them as her own little lions, from which she had to protect and she felt that she failed that on October 31st, 1981. She mourned for a long time for two of her favorite pupils' lives. She did not approve of Dumbledore's decision to leave Harry at his aunt and uncle's house. She volunteered to take him, but Albus shut her down. It was such a shame, she would have loved the Potter boy with all her heart as if he was her own son.

You look like you are about to start crying. Wait, does this have to do with James?" Sirius asked the woman that was one of his favorite adults and his hero of sorts quietly. "James shut the fuck up already" he said to his best friend's ramibilings. James looked down sheepish.

I am fine" said Professor McGonagall quietly. "So onto the story of Harry James Potter. He had a normal life with his mother, father, Godfather- Sirius, and uncles- Remus and Peter. That was until the halloween of 1981, when he was 15 months old. Voldemort came into his house, with the intent to kill harry, and k-killed James and later Lily-" everyone looked at the James that was sitting there with tears in their eyes, while James was beginning to sob. It was understandable, considering that he learned that he never go to raise his only son.

He killed James when he entered the house, and Lily, ran to the nursery to try to get Harry out of the house. She failed to do so, so she made a blood protection that kept him safe. Voldemort shot a killing curse at Harry-" all four of the Marauders' breaths hitched. "- but it backfired and hit him." the four let out a breath in relief. "Dumbledore had a charm on the house that would alert him of the Potters' deaths. Hagrid and another order member went to get him when the order member had to take revenge. Albus told me and we left to meet Rubus. Albus and I apperated to Privet Drive where Lily's older sister, brother-in-law, and nephew lived. Hagrid later came and we dropped Harry off there where he lived for the next 10 years, and every summer after that.-"

Onto second year then. I am going start when the attacks first happened. On Halloween night, Mr. Potter, Miss Granger, and Mr. Weasley were walking back to Gryffindor House when they found the caretaker's cat, and also former wife, but lets not get into that right now. They found Mrs. Norris petrified next to a sign painted in blood that said 'enemies to the heir, beware'. This, of course was referring to the heir of Slytherin and the monster in the Chamber of Secrets. The students guessed this, and after an incident involving Gilderoy Lockhart and a snake-shooting curse and Harry was discovered to be a parselmouth." the room went rigid because the Marauders were still processing the bit of information.

We are still trying to come up with a theory on why he is a parselmouth. Just by taking one look at the child, you can see the resemblance the other hand, please do not scream profanities in my office because this is a school with students and it is getting late and i would rather not my students wondering why people are shouting curses this late in the night and come in in curiosity and see people their age that are not meant to be in this timeline, so to put in your own kind of speech, shut the bloody hell up."  Professor McGonagall said sternly, the way that a mother might scold their child in the middle of a supermarket. All four of the Marauders were quite frankly shocked out of their wits and James cowered under the glare of the Professor.

He had no good memories of that blasted place. James put his hand on his brother's shoulder. Sirius never told him everything that his mother and father did to him. He just remembered all the times that Sirius found his way to Potter Manor over the summers. He had magical scars all over his arms and legs from various curses and magical knives that his mother used on him. The only reason he went back every summer was because he knew if he was there he was going to be the one getting hurt, not Regulus. Before either of them started at Hogwarts, they always came up with ways to escape and live free from their parents. Once Sirius was sorted into Gryffindor and was considered a disgrace to the Black family, Reg never talked to him anymore- most likely because he knew that if he did, he would get hurt by his parents, so he did everything to save himself from that punishment. That didn't work though. Walburga and Orion were bloodthirsty (more so than ducks. Sirius didn't know why, but he always hated those birds. It must be the mutt in him, because he thought ducks were bloodthirsty little beasts) and they always wanted someone to curse or hurt in some other way. Unfortunately that meant Regulus when their disappointment was away at school or ran away to James's house. That's basically why he never left Grimmauld Place until he was on the brink of death because he had to save his brother as much as he could. Call it Gryffindor stupidity, but he knew it was better for him to be abused than Reg.

But you were only a toddler when we left! You grew up! But of course, it is 20 years since then. Merlin, I keep on forgetting that we are 20 years into the future. Seriously- don't even dare Sirius-" James said freaking out a little bit and saw Sirius about to make a pun. "-I have a son and he is what? 15? And I never got to see him grow up!" James was close to tears now.

James was trying to sober up quickly and the other three boys put their hands on his shoulders. He was starting to feel better.

All the other Weasleys are of age and they are- by oldest to youngest- Bill, Charlie, and Percy, but Percy left his family because he doesn't believe that Voldemort has returned, and because of this, he has sided with the Ministry.

Peter, your new name will be Parker Peterson." Tonks said rather stiffly. Remus, James, and Sirius were all a little confused, but none of them thought that Peter heard her tone of voice, so they didn't say anything. Tonks started to continue, relaxing a little bit. "Sirius, your new name will be Sebastian-"

You will not name me Sebastian. Sebastian sounds like a psychopath who rapes his sister kind of name. And if I had a sister, I wouldn't rape her. So that's a no. How about..." Sirius thought for a little bit on what would be a good name. "Ooh, I know, how about Hunter Brown? The first name is astronomy related."

He wasn't against the name, but it did mean basically Wolf Wolf, or more so, both the names came from origins that had to do with wolves. Romulus meant 'wolf' and Lupa was the wolf goddess in Roman mythology. He was absolutly sure this Tonks person knew about the monster that he is.

She casted the spell that changed his features. When she was done, you could only see the resemblance if you looked hard enough. He know had freckles, a chubbier complection than before. Before, he was lanky and his face was shallow. Now, his face seemed fuller with his newly black hair and dark blue eyes and he looked a whole lot more handsome.

She casted the same spell as she did peter.

She faded his scars so then they were barely visible, darkened his hair a couple of shades, and changed his light brown eyes to a darker brown. She also added more freckles around his face.

A battered door emerged out of nowhere between numbers eleven and thirteen, followed swiftly by dirty walls and grimy windows. It was as though an extra house had inflated, pushing those on either side out of its way. James looked at it, astonished. He then looked to see if anyone in 11 or 13 saw anything, but he only saw the people in number 11 blasing their sterio, and the people in 13 sitting in their lounge, with the Christmas tree in one corner and watching something on the telly.

Remus looked at it and saw the house inflate before his eyes.

#&gt; 189 "Now that you all can see the house, all of you need to go inside of it before someone sees you lot." Tonks said as she was usering the Marauders in the dreary building. All of this was really weird for her, considering that as everyone knew, she had a huge crush on the Remus Lupin in her present, and he returned the feelings, but he always believed that he was a monster and didn't deserve her. He was wrong, though. She knew about him being a werewolf, but she didn't care because in her family she was raised not to have any prejudice about anyone- even if they were part of a species that were known to be ruthless and dangerous. This included werewolves, vampires, etc. and most of all wizards with a different blood status. Her mother grew up thinking that purebloods were a higher caliber of wizard and muggleborns were not real wizards, but that all changed when she met a muggleborn Hufflepuff named Ted Tonks. They were the forbidden love- Romeo and Juliet. Her mother rarely talked about her relatives that much, except when she was little when James and Sirius- her first cousin once removed, but he was more like a cousin- would always hang out with her. She always felt so important that cool teenagers would hang out with her of all people. Then, when she when she was 8, she was told by her sobbing parents that she would never see he cool cousins again. It wasn't until she got to Hogwarts that she learned the reason she never saw her best friends- one died a hero and one was a traitor, or so she thought. She was really sad because their other friend, who's name she could never pronounce- and didn't realized that she knew as an adult for a long time- was pretty cute in her opinion. And he still was (the present one at that, she wasn't a cradle robber!

"STAINS OF DISHONOR, FILTHY HALF-BREEDS, BLOOD TRAITORS, CHILDREN OF FILTH BEGONE FROM THIS HOUSE!" she screamed, scaring most everyone in the immediate area.

She had put him under the cruciatus curse, she'd done it before, but her thirst for blood escalated in the time of the school year, and before she only would put him under for anywhere from 35-45 seconds, but over the summer, she started to experiment to see how long the curse could be withheld without the victim going insane. The furthest she ever got with him was 3 minutes and 28 seconds.

Sirius saw a man in his 40s, in excentrict robes and a handlebar mustache, leaning against the door frame. It wasn't until Sirius got a better look at the man that he saw his face, really.

I must be going insane (too late). I actually finished this chapter on thursday (in time for Thanksgiving), but I was camping, so I didn't have any Wi-Fi, so I had wait till I got home to upload it, so here you go!

All four young Marauders were hanging on the edge of their seats. "The youngest Weasley, Ginny, was taken into the Chamber of Secrets!" The older Remus thought that the older Sirius was having way too much fun with this, "there was blood on the wall that said that she would spend the rest of eternity down there and her bones would rot for-ev-er!" He said in a dramatic voice.

It was bad enough that he let him go to the school, let alone teach it! What if he hurt one of the students?!

I went over the the Shrieking Shack because I figured that he would be there and found him. We hugged, and Harry and his friends started yelling at me because they still thought that Sirius was a murderer and killed those people, not Wo- the traitor. Sirius explained what really happened and turned the traitor- who was an animagus and lived as a pet for 12 years- back into a human, and all was good, until the full moon shone on me and I turned. I didn't take the Wolfsbane that was made because I forgot, so Sirius had to go after me. And the traitor ran away, along with the chance of Sirius's freedom.

"The three went to the infirmary, while Sirius was caught and was sent up to the Astronomy tower to get the kiss. Dumbledore told Harry and Hermione Granger to go back in time and fix everything that they could. In the end, Sirius escaped by leaving on the back of a hippogriff. And that's basically the year in a nutshell. Onto 4th year.

They all starred at the 4 boys in the common room.

They are transfer students. Meet Jameson Poulter, Hunter Brown, Ryan Lewis , and Parker Peterson." James and the younger Remus gave a nod of gratitude to the older Sirius for changing their names to something more fitting, so they liked it more. The older Sirius just winked at them, and became quiet, subtly glaring at Peter, who was somewhat oblivious, but the other boys saw, but didn't say anything.

They were very close, so we grew up together so we were best friends since birth, but one day, some death eaters destroy our house, but we were at a muggle frat party so we were safe. Dumbledore was a great family friend to all of us, so he let us come to the school, and since all of our parents were part of the Order during the first war, he knew that Grimmauld Place would be the safest choice for us until we get to school," Hunter explained rather quickly. They all had sad faces on and looked down on the ground, but Harry was a little suspicious. The whole explanation was like it was rehearsed, but Harry decided not to comment on it because he understood if they had to repeat the same tragedy over, and over, and over again, they probably would have what they said down to a T by now. He did the same thing with cedric- at least to those who believed him and knew the Voldemort was back.

I know how that feels, my parents died when I was a baby, so I had to live with my muggle relatives. They were horrible to me- they locked my in a cupboard until I got my Hogwarts letter, my cousin beat me up with his friends holding my arms back, and my aunt and uncle would make me go day without food or water if I showed any sign of accidental magic or did anything, in their words 'freakish'."

I need to go talk to Dumbledore and tell him all this to see if Molly or I can get anyway custody over you. I WILL NOT let you go back there. You should have never gone through all that at such a young age, ever. You won't have the same childhood I had, I just wont allow it. I love you Harry, always have, and always will. You will always have a family with me, Prongslet."

No one had ever said I love you to him before, nor ever been this kind. He'd known both Sirius and the Weasleys for years now, and he knew that they liked him a lot and cared for him, and even subconsciously, he knew they loved him, but it was different hearing it out loud. He had a family and that's all he needed.

THOSE FUCKING MUGGLES ABUSED HIS SON. HOW FUCKING DARE THEY!! He would get his revenge on them. Harry was only a child, already dealing with otherworldly problems, and the were ABUSING him.

Parker, Dumbledore wants to speak to you 6!" yelled a voice from the dining room. "And There's a last minute meeting, so all members, come to the meeting room!" the voice finished. "And also, Harry, Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Fred, and George-" the six got excited to be in an Order meeting "-go up to your rooms, and don't even try to listen in!" There was a simultaneous grone from the 6 teenagers along with a lot of mumbled protests, but they all knew not to cross Mrs. Weasley.

No one could imagine, even as seventh years, Molly and Author shagging that openly. And once the laughter ceased, everyone looked at the older Sirius for confirmation and the laughter resumed again, to the Weasleys' embarrassment. Once the laughter calmed down again, Kingsley expressed his doubts about the other three.

The older Sirius did the same thing to prove it was true. The only difference between the two dogs was one was a puppy and the other an older mutt. The older Remus had tear in his eyes because he knew that when am amingnus ages, it means that the person had grown up, in maturity along with age. Azkaban had aged him beyond his years. He couldn't even comprehend the hell that his best friend in the whole world went through. He lost most of his childhood spark in his eyes, but it had been coming back the more time he spent with Remus and Harry.
